In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "So in this problem we are dealing with only 395 students. so there are not many data to observe. So I would like to choose models which can **perform well with small number of observations** otherwise it will cause overfitting and also based on school requirement which they want classifier with **fast trainig and prediction speed** so it will take less time and also with school data we need classifier which **handles irrelevant features very well**.\n",

    "\n",
    "_weakness:_ Not being able to automatically learn features interactions, Needs some parameter tuning for feature extraction, Relies on independence assumption and will perform badly if this assumption is not met\n",
    "\n",
    "_Reason_: performs well with our small set of data - fast training and speed since the school like to spend less time - Handles irrelavent features very well which is good for our case since not all student data features are not related to assesing acceptance in final exam - It is easy to explain to school's officials - It is a classification model since we have categorical data\n",

    "This model is pretty fast to teach and also when it has been taught how to predict it is pretty fast to predict with good precision(F1 score). It is also suitable for categorical decision making as we are trying to category our students based on PASS or FAIL mark in their final exam.
