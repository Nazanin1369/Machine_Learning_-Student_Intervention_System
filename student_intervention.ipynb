In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

So I would like to choose models which can **perform well with small number of observations** otherwise it will cause overfitting and also based on school requirement which they want classifier with **fast trainig and prediction speed** so it will take less time and also with school data we need classifier which **handles irrelevant features very well**.\n",
